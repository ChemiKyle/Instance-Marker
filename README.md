<h2>Instance Marker - Display information about which instance of REDCap is being used.</h2>

<p>A single site may have multiple instances of REDCap that need to be clearly marked. Examples include Production, Backup and Development. By pattern matching the URL to the instance a small bit of matching text will be displayed in the top right corner of every page. Also, the tab title is prefixed with the first letter of the instance type. The module must be enabled on all projects by default in order for the instance label to appear inside projects or must be enabled on a project by project basis.</p>

<p>The goal is to easily identify which instance of REDCap you are currently in.</p>

<p>The marker can be placed anywhere on the screen.  The marker is fixed in that position. The image below is an example of how the marker will look when fixed to the bottom, left and right of the window. The opacity can be set.  The image below has opacity set to 80 (on a scale of 0 to 100).</p>
